# Promotional html emails

## WELCOME TO UDEMY COURSES 
I cloned this promotional email sent from Udemy's marketing department which promotes their reasons for people to buy educational courses from them. The courses are taught by people already finanacially successful in the industry they are teaching. Udemy lists the features and benefits they offer to help advance your career and life-long learning ambitions. They also provide useful 'quick-links' to their community. 

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:
html tables, html5, css3, mobile responsive, npm, webpack, web accessibility, NVDA, GITHUB , lighthouse audit, NETLIFY.

## ACCESSIBILITY:
I used accessibility code to increase this page's web accessibility. I mostly used aria-role landmarks and tabindex code to increase focus and access. There is a strong movement in the web development world to build and code web content that is accessible to everybody. Lawsuits and accessility standards are happenning regularly. Some statistics report there are over 1 billion people worldwide who have difficulties using web content because of different disabilities.
